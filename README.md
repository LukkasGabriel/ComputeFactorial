## How It Works

The program prompts the user to enter an integer, then calculates its factorial iteratively. The calculation is shown step by step, multiplying each consecutive number until the final result is reached.

### Example Execution

**Input:** Calculate your factorial: 5

**Output:** Calculating 5! 5 X 4 X 3 X 2 X 1 = 120



## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or copy the code into your Python editor.
2. Run the code.
3. When prompted, enter the number for which you want to calculate the factorial.
4. The program will display the calculation step by step and the final result.

## Code Structure

The code follows this structure:

1. Asks the user for an integer input.
2. Calculates the factorial of the number using a `while` loop.
3. Displays the step-by-step calculation (multiplications) until the final result.
4. Prints the factorial value.

### Technical Details

- The variable `f` stores the value of the factorial during the calculation.
- The variable `n` stores the current number being multiplied.
- The loop continues until `n` equals 0, at which point the calculation is complete.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x or higher.
